# **Mango Calculator**
## Stack Used: HTML, CSS & Base JavaScript
### This is my first attempt at a calculator! Using simple CSS and JS, I was able to create a functioning calculator that performs basic math arithmetics 
### I styled the calculator with a frosted glass background, rounded buttons with animated color shifting hover effects. The output screen also has an animated effect that displays a preview of the solution and swaps places with the input once the equals operation is clicked

## *want to add*
### 1. More button functions, such as an COS SIN TAN (eventually creating a graphing-like calculator
### 2. Keyboard inputs (be able to use the number pad and operators)
